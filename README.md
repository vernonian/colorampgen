Weclome to ColorampGen!

## Intro

### What is ColorampGen?

ColorampGen is a tool used for generating color ramps for web and UI design systems.

### Why ColorampGen?

As a UI designer, I was frusterated by my slow and repetative process of creating color ramps in Figma, so I created this to speed up my workflow.

### Who is ColorampGen for?

It is for anyone who wants to quickly generate a color ramp based on a single hex color code. I would say it's mainly for web, digital, and UI designers and developers, but anyone can use it.

## Notes to self
